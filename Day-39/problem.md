Approach: 

➡️ his solution uses Recursion.

➡️ For every node, it checks left height and right height.

➡️ It finds the maximum depth (height) of left and right subtrees.

➡️ If the height difference is more than 1, the tree is not balanced.

➡️ This check is done for every node in the tree.

➡️ If all nodes follow the rule, the tree is balanced.
